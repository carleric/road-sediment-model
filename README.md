# Purpose

The Road Sediment Model determines quantities of sediment delivered from forest roads into streams at road-stream intersections as a function of rainfall.  Sediment delivery can be aggregated by time interval and by harvest unit areas.  The tool was designed to be used by commercial forest managers to estimate the amount of sediment delivered during past activities or for planning for future operations.

The model was developed as while employed at Green Diamond Resource Company and subsequenty Stillwater Sciences.  It also served as the subject of my MSc project while studying Computing and Software Systems at the University of Washington, Tacoma.

# Code

Enclosed is a small, non-functional sample of some of the classes and functions from the model.  It was developed using the following technologies:

- Microsoft Visual Studio
- CSharp / C#
- ESRI ArcGIS
- Microsoft SQL Server
